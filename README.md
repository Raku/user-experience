# Raku User Experience

## Overview and Purpose

There are many aspects in the experience of Raku users: installation of a
compiler, getting help, reporting issues, and others. The purpose of this
repository is to help identify and address any deficiencies and issues in that
experience. Creation of an Issue on this repository is aimed to be part of
that process.

When encountering a Raku user who seems to be frustrated by any part of the
Raku experience, it is suggested they get directed to open an Issue on this
repository, so that the Raku Community can address it.
