# Getting Perl 6

# Goals

It must be possible for a person who is interested in Perl 6 to:

* Try out some code as soon as possible (e.g. an online "try it out" eval box)
* Install a Perl 6 compiler with as few steps as possible. The purpose here
should be to get them up and running with something usable, rather than dwell
on configuration options, finding an appropriate file to install on the user's
operating system, the differences between compilers and Virtual Machines
they're implemented on, the modules installed, etc.
* Install a specific Perl 6 compiler with specific options. This is aimed at
users who know what they want and who wish to obtain something more tailored.

# GetPerl6.com Website

GetPerl6.com has been registered (by Zoffix) and is expected to be the place
that addresses the [stated goals](#goals). The website will have just a single
goal:

---

> Get a user to run a Perl 6 program they wrote

---

All other objectives are the responsibility of other websites (such as
perl6.org and its subdomains).
