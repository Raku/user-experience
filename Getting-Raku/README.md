# Getting Raku

# Goals

It must be possible for a person who is interested in Raku to:

* Try out some code as soon as possible (e.g. an online "try it out" eval box)
* Install a Raku compiler with as few steps as possible. The purpose here
should be to get them up and running with something usable, rather than dwell
on configuration options, finding an appropriate file to install on the user's
operating system, the differences between compilers and Virtual Machines
they're implemented on, the modules installed, etc.
* Install a specific Raku compiler with specific options. This is aimed at
users who know what they want and who wish to obtain something more tailored.
